# Selection History

Selection History keeps track of your editor selection history.
It allows you to skip back/forward through your recently selected objects.

It works similar to your browser history or the back/forward function of your favorite IDE.

# Unitility

Unitility is a collection of small editor tools that enhances the everyday workflow with Unity.
Selection History is the first package of the Unitility collection.
More will follow in the near future...
